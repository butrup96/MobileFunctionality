## Hospital Functionality for a Mobile Application.

Neuroscience division wanted an app that educated users on the various neurological diseases and their symptoms. My task was to create a scrolling menu
that had a list of symptom buttons that would take a user to their corresponding disease. The functionality would also 
include 5 diseases that users could read about without having to select the symptom navigation tool. The disease pages would include the symptoms as well.
Users would tap the symptoms button to see a list of symptoms. Choosing a symptom would take them to the corresponding disease.
XML files are included with layout information. First introduction to Android Studio 3.5.
